I spend most of my time writing code, then realizing I can automate that code, then writing more code to do that. I'm a big fan of the **JVM** ecosystem, but I’m currently seeing if the **Rust** hype is real (spoiler: it is).

**What I'm up to:**

* Building stuff that scales (or at least doesn't break immediately).
* Enchancing my existing projects.
